1. Launch a probe from the Moon toward Earth.

2. Initialize probe:

    x = --- ;
    y = --- ;
   vx = speed * cos( angle ) ;
   vy = speed * sin( angle ) ;

3. Initial (x,y) not critical.

4. But this seems to work well:

    x = ( 2 * Rm ) * cos( angle ) ;
    y = ( 2 * Rm ) * sin( angle ) ;

5. Survey pairs of the two parameters (speed, angle).
For each pair you need to characterize the outcome of
the run.  Does the probe crash into the Moon?  Do we
even exit the Earth-Moon system?  In cases that exit
the system:

    speed > sqrt( 2 * G * mE / rE )

Idea is to make one pass around Earth first and then
have a subsequent interaction with the Moon, which in
the meantime will have been continuing on its own way
around its regular orbit.

6. Are there other possible outcomes?

Yes. Some example are going around the earth in a slingshot-esque motion and then going around the moon again
which can repeat for a while.

7. Use angle = 181 , 182 , ... , 269 degrees

8. Use speeds that escape the Moon initially but are
not already escaping the Earth.

9. MPI, split the pairs across multiple workers.

10. Describe your runtime and what pair did you find
that maximizes the exit speed?

Max: [242.050000 deg, 2970.000000 v0, 2334.249536 vmax]

Goes very close to the earth, which gives a large bit of speed, then passes very close to the moon 
which adjusts angle of exit upwards and provides more speed.
